# RGB-D-SLAM
Do something special with RGB-D SLAM(Process see below)

Start with Hello World use Cmake in Linux.

Get learnd about the opencv lib and point cloud lib, and try to read an image and transform it to PCL image.

Using feature detector and descriptor to estimate the motion between two images, and use PNP to simplify the matching results.

Combine the two pcl image using transform matrix

Use the datasets of http://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html, and build a visual odometry.

Use pose diagram and through g2o to optimise the diagram
